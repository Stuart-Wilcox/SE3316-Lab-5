# SE3316-Lab-5

This project was created to meet the requirements of SE3316 Web Technologies Lab 5, which was to make a web application where users could view photos and search photos from NASA's public API, and once signed in could maintain collections of their own. They could also see other users' collections if they were public and vote on the collections.
